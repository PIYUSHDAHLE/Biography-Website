            <p>Jeff Bezos is an American billionaire business magnate, media proprietor, and investor. He is the
                founder, executive chairman, and former president and CEO of Amazon, the world's largest e-commerce and
                cloud computing company.</p>

            <p>Bezos was born in Albuquerque, New Mexico, on January 12, 1964. He was adopted by his stepfather, Mike
                Bezos, when he was four years old. Bezos's family moved to Houston, Texas, when he was a child, where he
                attended River Oaks Elementary School and Miami Palmetto Senior High School.</p>

            <p>Bezos graduated from Princeton University in 1986 with degrees in electrical engineering and computer
                science. After graduation, he worked on Wall Street in a variety of related fields, including computer
                science, finance, and telecommunications.</p>

            </div>

            <p>In 1994, Bezos quit his job on Wall Street to start Amazon.com, an online bookstore. Bezos's vision for
                Amazon was to create a "one-stop shop" for everything people might want to buy online. He started by
                selling books, but quickly expanded to sell other products, such as electronics, music, and apparel.</p>

            <p>Amazon quickly became one of the most successful companies on the internet. Bezos's focus on customer
                satisfaction and his willingness to experiment with new business models have been key to Amazon's
                success.</p>

            <p>In addition to Amazon, Bezos is also the founder of the aerospace company Blue Origin. He is also the
                owner of The Washington Post newspaper.</p>

            <p> Bezos is one of the wealthiest people in the world. His net worth is estimated to be over $150 billion.
                He has been ranked as the richest person in the world by Forbes magazine for several years in a row.</p>

            <p> Bezos is a controversial figure. He has been criticized for Amazon's labor practices and its impact on
                small businesses. However, he is also admired for his business acumen and his vision for the future.</p>

            <p>
                After graduation, Bezos worked on Wall Street in a variety of related fields from 1986 to early 1994.
                Bezos founded Amazon in late 1994 on a road trip from New York City to Seattle. He started Amazon as an
                online bookstore, but it quickly expanded to sell a wide variety of products. </p>

            <p>Under Bezos' leadership, Amazon has become the world's largest online retailer and cloud computing
                company. Amazon is also one of the most valuable companies in the world. Bezos has been widely praised
                for his business acumen and his vision for the future of e-commerce. </p>

            <p>In addition to Amazon, Bezos is also the founder of the space exploration company Blue Origin and the
                owner of The Washington Post newspaper. Bezos is one of the richest people in the world, with a net
                worth of over $160 billion.
