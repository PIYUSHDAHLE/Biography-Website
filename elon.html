            <p>Elon Musk (born June 28, 1971) is a business magnate, investor, and engineer. He is the founder, CEO, CTO
                and chief designer of SpaceX; CEO of Tesla, Inc.; owner and CEO of Twitter, Inc.; founder of Neuralink
                and OpenAI; president of the Musk Foundation; and co-founder of The Boring Company. </p>

            <p>Musk was born in Pretoria, South Africa, and briefly attended the University of Pretoria before
                immigrating to Canada at age 18, acquiring citizenship through his Canadian-born mother. He transferred
                to the University of Pennsylvania two years later, where he received bachelor's degrees in economics and
                physics. Musk moved to California in 1995 to attend a PhD program in physics at Stanford University, but
                dropped out after two days to pursue a business career.</p>

            <p>In 1995, Musk and his brother Kimbal co-founded Zip2, a web software company which was acquired by Compaq
                Computers in 1999 for $307 million. Musk then founded X.com, an online financial services company. In
                2000, X.com merged with Confinity to form PayPal, which was acquired by eBay in 2002 for $1.5 billion.
                Musk received $180 million from the sale of PayPal.</p>

            </div>

            <p>In 2002, Musk founded SpaceX, an aerospace manufacturer and space transport services company. He became
                the company's CEO and chief designer. In 2004, Musk joined electric vehicle manufacturer Tesla Motors,
                Inc. (now Tesla, Inc.) as chairman and product architect. He became CEO of the company in 2008.

            <p>In 2016, Musk co-founded Neuralink, a neurotechnology company focused on developing brain–computer
                interfaces. In the same year, he co-founded OpenAI, a non-profit research company that promotes friendly
                artificial intelligence. In 2016, Musk founded The Boring Company, a tunnel construction company.</p>

            <p>In 2022, Musk acquired Twitter, Inc., a social media company.</p>

            <p>Musk is one of the wealthiest people in the world, with an estimated net worth of US$232 billion as of
                September 2023, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, and $253 billion according to Forbes,
                primarily from his ownership stakes in both Tesla and SpaceX.</p>

            <p>Musk is a controversial figure, but there is no doubt that he is one of the most successful and
                influential entrepreneurs of our time. He has revolutionized the way we explore space, drive cars, and
                consume information.</p>
