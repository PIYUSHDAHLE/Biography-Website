            <p>Bill Gates is an American billionaire, philanthropist, and investor best known for co-founding the
                software giant Microsoft, along with his childhood friend Paul Allen. During his career at Microsoft,
                Gates held the positions of chairman, chief executive officer (CEO), president, and chief software
                architect, while also being its largest individual shareholder until May 2014. He was a major
                entrepreneur of the microcomputer revolution of the 1970s and 1980s.</p>
            <p>Gates was born on October 28, 1955, in Seattle, Washington. He developed an early interest in computers
                and began programming at the age of 13. In 1973, Gates enrolled at Harvard University, but he dropped
                out in his junior year to focus on Microsoft.</p>
            <p>Gates served as CEO of Microsoft until 2000, when he stepped down to focus on philanthropy. He continues
                to be the chairman of the board of directors of Microsoft.</p>

                1981, Microsoft released its MS-DOS operating system, which became the standard operating system for IBM
                PCs and other personal computers. In 1985, Microsoft released the first version of its Windows operating
                system, which eventually became the dominant operating system in the world.</p>

                around the world.</p>

            <p>Bill co-founded Microsoft Corporation in 1975 with Paul Allen and led the company to become the worldwide
